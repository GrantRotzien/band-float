      <p>Self-termed "acoustic house" and "alternative pop" duo Life of Dillon consists of David Keiffer and Joe Griffith, aka Joe Femi. The act took shape in late 2014, though the musicians had known one another since their high school years. </p>

      <p>Signed to Disruptor, a division of major-label Epic, and temporarily joined by Joe's brother Robert, Life of Dillon made their debut in 2015 with the anthemic single "Overload," which in turn became the lead track on an EP, Prologue. They subsequently toured North America with Charlie Puth and Meghan Trainor. </p>

      <p>The following year, Keiffer and Joe moved to Los Angeles as Life of Dillon continued as a duo. They concentrated on developing new material for several months, and in early 2017 released the strummy and breezy single "Sex for Breakfast" as the first step toward their first proper album.</p>
